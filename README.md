Datasets to be Used
https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/4pq5-n9py ("Skilled Nursing Facility Provider Information - General information on currently active nursing homes, including number of certified beds, quality measure scores, staffing and other information used in the Five-Star Rating System. Data are presented as one row per nursing home.”)

Project Description/Outline

  Research Questions to Answer - Guidance from the Xpert:
  
    Is there a correlation between the number of certified beds in a nursing home and its quality measure scores?
    
    How does the staffing levels of nursing homes relate to their Five-Star Rating System scores?
    
    Are there any trends in quality measure scores based on the location or region of the nursing homes?
    
    What is the distribution of certified beds across nursing homes in different states or areas?
    
    Is there a relationship between the size of a nursing home (number of certified beds) and the average staffing levels?
    
    Can we identify any outliers in the data that may indicate areas for further investigation or improvement?
    
    How do different quality measures correlate with each other within the dataset?
    
    Are there any patterns in the data that suggest certain factors have a significant impact on the overall rating of a nursing home?
    
    How does the average quality measure score vary for nursing homes with different ownership types?
    
    Is there a relationship between the staffing levels and the quality of care provided in nursing homes?

  Data Visualization Tasks - Guidance from the Xpert:
  
    Correlation between Number of Certified Beds and Quality Measure Scores:
    
      Visualization: A scatter plot showing the relationship between the number of certified beds and quality measure scores for each nursing home.
      
      Insights: This analysis can help determine if there is a relationship between the size of the nursing home (number of beds) and the quality of care provided.
      
    Staffing Levels and Five-Star Rating System Scores:
    
      Visualization: Bar chart or line graph comparing staffing levels with Five-Star Rating System scores.
      
      Insights: This analysis can reveal how staffing levels impact the overall rating of nursing homes.
      
    Trends in Quality Measure Scores by Location or Region:
    
      Visualization: Heatmap or geographical map showing quality measure scores across different regions or states.
      
      Insights: This analysis can identify regions with higher or lower quality measure scores and potential areas for improvement.
      
    Distribution of Certified Beds Across Nursing Homes in Different States:
    
      Visualization: Box plot or histogram showing the distribution of certified beds in nursing homes by state.
      
      Insights: This analysis can provide insights into the variation in the size of nursing homes across different states.
      
    Relationship between Nursing Home Size and Average Staffing Levels:
    
      Visualization: Scatter plot or regression analysis showing the relationship between the number of certified beds and staffing levels.
      
      Insights: This analysis can help understand how the size of a nursing home influences its staffing levels.
      
    Identification of Outliers in the Data:
    
      Visualization: Box plot or scatter plot highlighting outliers in the data.
      
      Insights: Identifying outliers can indicate areas that require further investigation or improvement in terms of quality measures.
      
    Correlation between Different Quality Measures:
    
      Visualization: Correlation matrix or heatmap showing the relationships between different quality measures.
      
      Insights: Understanding how different quality measures correlate can provide a comprehensive view of the overall quality of care.
      
    Factors Impacting Overall Rating of Nursing Homes:
    
      Visualization: Decision tree analysis or feature importance plot to identify factors influencing the overall rating.
      
      Insights: This analysis can reveal which factors have a significant impact on the overall rating of nursing homes.
      
    Variation in Quality Measure Scores by Ownership Types:
    
      Visualization: Grouped bar chart or box plot comparing quality measure scores across different ownership types.
      
      Insights: Understanding how quality measure scores vary by ownership type can help in assessing performance differences.
      
    Relationship between Staffing Levels and Quality of Care:
    
      Visualization: Scatter plot or regression analysis showing the relationship between staffing levels and quality measure scores.
      
      Insights: This analysis can determine if higher staffing levels lead to better quality of care in nursing homes.

Breakdown of Task:

  Data Acquisition and Cleaning:

    Task: Find and retrieve the dataset from a curated source (e.g., Kaggle, data.world).

    Section Leader: Ellis McWhirter

    Sub-Tasks:
      
      Search for suitable datasets related to the chosen field (finance, healthcare, or custom).

      Evaluate datasets based on relevance, quality, and size.
      
      Download the selected dataset and ensure it complies with licensing and usage terms.

      Clean the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and formatting inconsistencies.

  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

    Task: Perform initial exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's characteristics and relationships.

    Section Leader: John Hayes

    Sub-Tasks:

      Use Jupyter Notebook to load the dataset and explore its structure and contents.

      Generate summary statistics, distributions, and visualizations to gain insights.

      Identify potential patterns, trends, and outliers within the data.

      Document the EDA process and findings in the notebook.

  Data Analysis and Visualization:

    Task: Conduct in-depth data analysis using statistical techniques and create visualizations to support findings.

    Section Leader: Allison Chase

    Sub-Tasks:

      Perform statistical analysis such as aggregation, correlation, and time series analysis.

      Create visualizations (e.g., plots, charts) to illustrate key insights and trends.

      Ensure visualizations are properly labeled and formatted for clarity.

      Interpret the results of the analysis and relate them to the project's objectives.

  Presentation Preparation:

    Task: Develop the group presentation and ensure all members are ready to deliver their parts.

    Section Leader: James Brannan

    Sub-Tasks:

      Create a slide deck outlining the project's scope, methodology, findings, and conclusions.

      Coordinate with other group members to integrate their analysis and visualizations into the presentation.

      Rehearse the presentation multiple times to ensure smooth delivery and adherence to time limits.

      Prepare speaking notes for each group member to guide their presentation segments.

  GitHub Repository Management and Documentation:

    Task: Manage the GitHub repository, organize files, and compile final documentation.
    
    Section Leader: Matthew Sanders

    Sub-Tasks:

      Set up the GitHub repository and ensure all group members have access.
      
      Create directories and structure within the repository for code, data, and documentation.

      Manage version control by reviewing and merging code contributions from group members.

      Compile a comprehensive README file summarizing the project, data sources, methodology, and findings.

      Ensure the final repository meets professional quality standards and is ready for submission.
