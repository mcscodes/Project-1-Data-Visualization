Datasets to be Used
https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/4pq5-n9py ("Skilled Nursing Facility Provider Information - General information on currently active nursing homes, including number of certified beds, quality measure scores, staffing and other information used in the Five-Star Rating System. Data are presented as one row per nursing home.‚Äù)

Project Description/Outline

  Research Questions to Answer - Guidance from the Xpert:
  
    Is there a correlation between the number of certified beds in a nursing home and its quality measure scores?
    
    How does the staffing levels of nursing homes relate to their Five-Star Rating System scores?
    
    Are there any trends in quality measure scores based on the location or region of the nursing homes?
    
    What is the distribution of certified beds across nursing homes in different states or areas?
    
    Is there a relationship between the size of a nursing home (number of certified beds) and the average staffing levels?
    
    Can we identify any outliers in the data that may indicate areas for further investigation or improvement?
    
    How do different quality measures correlate with each other within the dataset?
    
    Are there any patterns in the data that suggest certain factors have a significant impact on the overall rating of a nursing home?
    
    How does the average quality measure score vary for nursing homes with different ownership types?
    
    Is there a relationship between the staffing levels and the quality of care provided in nursing homes?

  Data Visualization Tasks - Guidance from the Xpert:
  
    Correlation between Number of Certified Beds and Quality Measure Scores:
    
      Visualization: A scatter plot showing the relationship between the number of certified beds and quality measure scores for each nursing home.
      
      Insights: This analysis can help determine if there is a relationship between the size of the nursing home (number of beds) and the quality of care provided.
      
    Staffing Levels and Five-Star Rating System Scores:
    
      Visualization: Bar chart or line graph comparing staffing levels with Five-Star Rating System scores.
      
      Insights: This analysis can reveal how staffing levels impact the overall rating of nursing homes.
      
    Trends in Quality Measure Scores by Location or Region:
    
      Visualization: Heatmap or geographical map showing quality measure scores across different regions or states.
      
      Insights: This analysis can identify regions with higher or lower quality measure scores and potential areas for improvement.
      
    Distribution of Certified Beds Across Nursing Homes in Different States:
    
      Visualization: Box plot or histogram showing the distribution of certified beds in nursing homes by state.
      
      Insights: This analysis can provide insights into the variation in the size of nursing homes across different states.
      
    Relationship between Nursing Home Size and Average Staffing Levels:
    
      Visualization: Scatter plot or regression analysis showing the relationship between the number of certified beds and staffing levels.
      
      Insights: This analysis can help understand how the size of a nursing home influences its staffing levels.
      
    Identification of Outliers in the Data:
    
      Visualization: Box plot or scatter plot highlighting outliers in the data.
      
      Insights: Identifying outliers can indicate areas that require further investigation or improvement in terms of quality measures.
      
    Correlation between Different Quality Measures:
    
      Visualization: Correlation matrix or heatmap showing the relationships between different quality measures.
      
      Insights: Understanding how different quality measures correlate can provide a comprehensive view of the overall quality of care.
      
    Factors Impacting Overall Rating of Nursing Homes:
    
      Visualization: Decision tree analysis or feature importance plot to identify factors influencing the overall rating.
      
      Insights: This analysis can reveal which factors have a significant impact on the overall rating of nursing homes.
      
    Variation in Quality Measure Scores by Ownership Types:
    
      Visualization: Grouped bar chart or box plot comparing quality measure scores across different ownership types.
      
      Insights: Understanding how quality measure scores vary by ownership type can help in assessing performance differences.
      
    Relationship between Staffing Levels and Quality of Care:
    
      Visualization: Scatter plot or regression analysis showing the relationship between staffing levels and quality measure scores.
      
      Insights: This analysis can determine if higher staffing levels lead to better quality of care in nursing homes.
