Summary

Analyzing a large data set from Data.CMS.govs, Provider Information covering “general information on currently active nursing homes, including number of certified beds, quality measure scores, staffing, and other information in the Five-Star Rating System” in the United States, Group 1 aimed to answer these questions (https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/4pq5-n9py):
- Where could there be good markets to open a new facility?
- What makes a good nursing facility and how does the Five-Star System reflect that?
- What are negative indicators to look out for in a facility?
- What is the health deficiency score and how does it effect a rating?
- Does a Non-Profit label guarantee better care to patients?


Analysis Results

In this project, our hypothetical clients engaged us to assist in launching a skilled nursing facility. After conducting some preliminary research, they discovered that the Centers for Medicare Services (CMS) employs a 5-Star Rating System to evaluate these facilities. This system, however, utilizes a complex array of differentially weighted metrics, making it challenging to alter a rating once assigned. Notably, it can take up to four years for negative metrics to be removed from the scoring cycle.

Identifying Optimal Markets for a New Facility

Our analysis of facilities by state indicated potential markets that are less saturated and could be promising for new locations. Initially, states like Alaska (AK) seemed appealing, whereas Iowa (IA) appeared more moderate. However, a per capita analysis revealed that Alaska is one of the worst options for placement, while Iowa emerges as one of the least dense markets. This suggests that Iowa, with fewer nursing homes relative to its population, offers a significant opportunity for a new facility.

Understanding the 5-Star System

To better inform our clients, we examined the distribution of 5-Star nursing home ratings across various states. This analysis provided a reference point for the average scores to aim for. States like Iowa (IA) and North Dakota (ND) do not rank among the highest, suggesting that the competition may not be as intense in these regions.

Characteristics of High-Quality Nursing Facilities

Our investigation into staffing patterns revealed a positive correlation between Nurse Aide staffing hours per resident and higher 5-Star ratings. Given that Nurse Aides handle most daily care activities, this correlation is logical. Conversely, Licensed Practical Nurse hours per resident showed no significant correlation with 5-Star ratings, indicating that increasing these hours may not impact the rating. Registered Nurse hours per resident also showed a positive correlation with 5-Star ratings, similar to Nurse Aide hours. These findings suggest that high-rated facilities typically ensure substantial Registered Nurse and Nurse Aide hours per resident.

Negative Indicators in Nursing Facilities

While facilities receive numerous complaints, only those investigated and substantiated affect the overall score. Even 5-star facilities receive complaints, so the goal is to minimize them. The quality of staff plays a crucial role in keeping complaint levels low, as does the time spent with patients. We observed a correlation between ownership type and complaint volume, with for-profit facilities tending to receive more complaints than government-run ones. This may be due to better pay and job security in government positions. Potential investors should investigate why certain areas, such as Los Angeles and the Great Lakes region, have higher complaint volumes.

Impact of Health Deficiency Scores

The Health Deficiency Score measures the severity and likelihood of deficiencies in a facility, with higher scores indicating severe infractions. Facilities can receive an abuse icon on Nursing Home Compare (NHC) if they meet specific criteria related to harm or potential harm from abuse. Our analysis found that facilities with higher health deficiency scores tend to have lower 5-Star ratings. Notably, for-profit facilities often have higher health deficiency scores compared to government-run facilities, which typically score lower.

Evaluating Non-Profit and For-Profit Facilities

“For-Profit” nursing homes incur the majority of fines compared to government and non-profit homes. This is partly due to the market dominance of for-profit facilities. When examining fines per facility category, the differences become less pronounced, especially when outliers are excluded. Non-profit status does not necessarily guarantee better care, as the number of fines per facility type is relatively similar. There is a negative correlation between higher 5-Star ratings and the total amount of fines, with higher-rated facilities generally paying less in fines. However, even 5-star facilities can incur fines up to around $200,000.

Recommendations for New Facilities

Clients aiming to establish new nursing facilities should focus on areas with a high need for such services, invest adequately in Nurse Aides and Registered Nurses to ensure high hours per patient, hire quality staff to minimize complaints, ensure rigorous regulation and staff training to prevent abuse, and strive to maintain a Health Deficiency Score of zero. These strategies should help make new facilities highly competitive. Additionally, examining the management practices of government-run facilities could provide valuable insights, as they tend to perform well.

Next Steps

Further research is warranted to understand why certain areas have higher complaint volumes. Factors such as management practices, population size, availability of skilled labor, and state regulations may influence facility performance and should be explored in greater detail.
